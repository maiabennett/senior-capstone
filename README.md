# An analysis of circulating, colon- and intestine-residing innate lymphoid cell (ILC) phenotypes and functions

This is the repository for Maia Bennett's Senior Capstone in Bioinformatics (BS) at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. This project, "investigating the roles of innate immune cells in intestinal immunity and gut microbiome signaling," will be completed in May 2023.

## The main goal of this project is to identify potential ILC-microbiome cross-regulation.
- The first aim of this project is to quantify the phenotypic composition of ILCs across three public human scRNA-seq datasets using Seurat (v4).
- The second aim of this project is to investigate phenotypic differences between ILCs in humans with normal and dysregulated (IBD) gut conditions using Seurat (v4).
- The third aim of this project is to establish potential involvement of ILCs in microbiome regulation using pathfindR.

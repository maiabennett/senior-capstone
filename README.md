# An analysis of colon-, gut-, and intestine-residing innate lymphoid cell (ILC) profiles

This is the repository for Maia Bennett's Senior Capstone in Bioinformatics (BS) at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. 

## The main goal of this project is to identify potential ILC-microbiome cross-regulation.
- The first aim of this project is to quantify the phenotypic composition of ILC subtypes (ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s) across three public human scRNA-seq datasets using Seurat (v4).
- The second aim of this project is to establish potential involvement of ILCs in microbiome regulation using pathfindR.
- The third aim of this project is to investigate evidence of ILC composition change between humans with normal and dysregulated (IBD) gut conditions using Seurat (v4).
